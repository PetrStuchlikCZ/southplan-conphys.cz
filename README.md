Web application for civil engineering calculations built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP (without a database). Includes tools for structural and geodetic calculations.

Civil Engineering Calculations ‚Äì Web Application

This repository contains a web-based application for various civil engineering calculations. The app is built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP, currently without database support.

üîß Features (planned & implemented):

Calculation of steel section characteristics

Design and analysis of concrete elements (beams, continuous slabs, etc.)

Geodetic tools (contour line interpolation, earthwork volume calculation)

User-friendly interface with multiple calculation modules

üìà The application is intended as a personal learning project, combining my civil engineering background with web development. Future updates may include a database and expanded functionality.

‚ö†Ô∏è Note on Git usage

I connected this project to Git only at the final stage of development, as I was still learning how to work with version control. Everything is on branch master. Therefore, the commit history may not fully reflect the actual step-by-step workflow as it would be in a professional setting.
